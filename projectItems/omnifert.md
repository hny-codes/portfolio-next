## Omnifert

Omnifert is a Ghanaian mockup eCommerce site that feature various types of fertilizers to farmers. Unlike some other featured projects, **this project is much greater in both size and scope**.

This project features familiar functionality that you would see from other eCommerce sites. You can browse a list of products, add a product to a local cart and even check out! All assets and designs are recreated from Figma.

## Features

Because this project is mainly on the frontend aspect, **there are no backend features or any features that relate to the backend, with some being omitted completely.** However, here are a list of features that are available within the project:

- Dynamic routes per Product item
- Dynamic routes per Article page
- State management handled by [Nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores)
- Fake shopping cart functionality
- Fake shopping cart check-out
- Page pagination between Article pages

## What I learned

This project allowed me to further **practice my frontend skills since this project** has much more **depth** compared to other featured projects. In addition, I even got to practice incorporating new technologies such as **Nanostores for state management**.
