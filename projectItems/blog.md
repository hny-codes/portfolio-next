The purpose of this project is to create a personal blog while trying out Contentful CMS.

At the time of this project, _I am not too well-versed when it comes to using CMS'es_ and although I have heard of multiple ones such as Shopify, Wordpress, and Drupal, I wanted to practice my front-end skills utilizing one as the back-end (headless CMS).

**Creating this project allowed me to learn more about what's it like to use a CMS, connecting one to my front-end, and managing my content (blog posts).**

In addition, this project allowed me to practice creating websites utilizing the Astro framework and the power behind it, such as **built-in pagination** and **dynamic routes**.
