## hny-blogs

As a developer, having a personal blog is definitely something I wanted to make since not only would it allow me to **improve my writing skills**, but it would also **reinforce** the topics I learned by talking about it!

At the same time, I also wanted to try incorporating something new to my project as this is the perfect opportunity to branch out and try something new â€” a CMS!

At the time of this project, _I wasn't that well-versed when it comes to using CMS'es_ and although I have heard of multiple ones such as Shopify, Wordpress, and Drupal, I wanted to practice my front-end skills utilizing one as the back-end (headless CMS).

**Creating this project allowed me to learn more about what's it like to use a CMS, connecting one to my front-end, and managing my content (blog posts).**

In addition, this project allowed me to practice creating websites utilizing the Astro framework and the power behind it, such as **built-in pagination** and **dynamic routes**.

The entire experience from design to development gave me a fresh sense of joy - one that came from finishing a project that had both frontend and backend!
