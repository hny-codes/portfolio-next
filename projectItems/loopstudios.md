## Loopstudios Landing Page

Here's another landing page that utilizes Framer Motion, a **production-ready animation library for React websites**. Implementing Framer Motion was quite easy and it gave the landing page a very pleasant feel to it, especially the animated orchestration of the sample project items! 

**(PS: This portfolio also uses Framer Motion!)**

This project is the solution to one of the [Frontend Mentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/loopstudios-landing-page-N88J5Onjw).

## The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
