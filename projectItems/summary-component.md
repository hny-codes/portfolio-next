The purpose of this project is to create a reusable React component with populated data from a **json** file.

In addition, this project is one of my earliest projects where I first utilized **Typescript** on my development journey.

This project is the solution to one of the [Frontend Mentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV).

## The Challenge

Users **should** be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
