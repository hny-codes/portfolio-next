## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to build a personal portfolio for myself as well as try out new libraries to help assist on building it - a combination of building and learning as I go.

## Setup
To run this project locally, install the necessary dependencies using NPM:
```
$ npm install
```

Afterward, run the project in dev mode:
```
$ npm run dev
```


## Built with
Here are the libraries I used to build this portfolio. Outside basic React with JavaScript, everything used here is a new learning experience for me.

- [Next.js 13.4.4](https://nextjs.org/) using App router
- Typescript
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Framer Motion Animation Library](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [Lucide-Icons](https://lucide.dev/)

## My Process
My process for developing the portfolio can be easily summed up as 3 steps:
1. Research
2. Prototype
3. Development
4. The Future

### Research
In order to create a portfolio, I wanted some inspiration on what some modern portfolios looked like, especially one with a focus on development like mine.

For this stage in development, I went and researched designs on these 2 sites:
- [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/)
- [Site Inspire](https://www.siteinspire.com/)

Doing this research allowed me to gain some insight as to how to design my portfolio and taken the right steps on creating it.

### Prototype
After the research stage, I decided to make a rough prototype of my site using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) design tools. Nothing too deep on the prototype, just a simple markup for what I wanted my portfolio to potentially look like, the layout, colors, etc.

### Development
Once I had an idea of what I wanted my project to look like, I went on and gather the tools I needed in order to create the design I wanted. At the same time, I also wanted to try out various libraries that I came across in my development journey, which is the secondary purpose of this project. 

### The Future
This is not a one-and-done project, as I plan on updating the site and content sometime in the future when necessary. This may include:
- Adding more projects
- Bug fixes
- UI improvements

## Resources
Outside of the documentation of the libraries, here are other resources I have used for this project:
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for prototyping
- [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) to help generate a color palette for my portfolio
- [Site Inspire](https://www.siteinspire.com/) for research
- [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/) for research
- [Radix UI Documentation](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/overview/introduction) to edit shadcn components
